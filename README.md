# Rails API + Ember + Google Oauth2 

An example on how to connect the two applications.

Please refer to the [Article on Medium](https://medium.com/@coorasse/rails-ember-google-oauth2-807e24c3266)

## Setup

For the Backend:

    bundle
    cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml
    
For the Frontend:

    yarn install
    
You'll need to generate a Google API Application and replace the client_id and client_secret both on Backend and on Frontend.
